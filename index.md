- I like to play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. 
- I enjoy playing video games, and Stardew Valley is one that I've been playing a lot. 
- I really enjoy swimming (not competitively, recreationally). 

### Technical Background

    I have experience with a few programming languages, including C++, Visual Basic, Python, and Java. I
    have also programmed a few robots, including a BOE Bot, Ruby (not with the Ruby language, it was
    with some other language), and a robot for a VEX competition.
